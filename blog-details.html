            <div class="article-content">
                <p class="intro">I was born in 1994. I am told both my parents were drunk at the time I was born and
                    there were rarely sober throughout
                    the pregnancy. My parent’s house is part of the homestead in grandpa’s compound so our home is less
                    than half a
                    kilometre from grandpa’s house. My father was the first in a family of six children. He was the
                    first graduate in the
                    village and I am told that as he ascended in education, people in the village followed up his
                    education story; and they
                    were convinced that he was going back to transform their lives.</p>

                <h2>The Descent Into Addiction</h2>
                <p>As he studied the more, he also started travelling to other countries and the village found it very
                    impressive. He drove
                    his first car home the day after he graduated from the University of Nairobi. Multitudes of people
                    congregated at my
                    grandfather’s home just to greet him and they were all invited to the graduation party, which was
                    thrown later that
                    evening. According to my grandma, Nana, the event was a village affair, people carried all sorts of
                    gifts, in form of
                    food
                    and others volunteered labour.
                    According to Nana, my dad was a big deal. Shortly after the big ceremony, he left for Kampala where
                    he was employed in
                    the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and later posted to the United Kingdom in the Ugandan Embassy. He
                    was his parents’ gem.
                    He remained the gem, until he married my mother.
                    My mother came from the neighbouring village, Pakoi. She was a grade 5 teacher and a seasonal
                    drinker. Nana says she did
                    not approve of the marriage but she was not listened to. The couple took a little bit of time
                    without children, which
                    must have exerted a lot of pressure on them. The few times Nana visited them in London she was not
                    happy with the family
                    status, and she describes the home as a battle ground.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Addiction isn't about substances - it's about the void we're trying to fill. FORE helped me
                    understand that emptiness and how to heal it."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Five years down the road, mum got pregnant. Dad was transferred back to Uganda to a position, which
                    was lower than the
                    one he held in London because he was reported to be drinking excessively. My mum drunk even more.
                    Back in Kampala, mum
                    was not working, she was pregnant, and she would spend time at home. After a series of family
                    meetings, in trying to
                    bring peace between my parents, my mother confessed that the pregnancy had turned her into a
                    miserable drunkard.
                    The day I was born, Nana was already in my parents’ house to receive her first grandchild, and so
                    was my maternal
                    grandmother. My mother was driven to the hospital; unfortunately she had bottles of liquor in her
                    bag. The two grandmas
                    had grown tired of talking about the drinking habit and she was simply being tolerated. She had a
                    normal delivery and I
                    was named Mercy.
                    My father died four years later in a road accident. He was drunk and his car was knocked down by
                    another motorist, who
                    was in the same state of mind.
                    My mother moved to the village around six months later. “She must have been frustrated,” Nana says.
                    My mother turned into a woman who drunk anything alcoholic. She always came home late in the night
                    and her arrival was
                    always announced by her noise. She would shout right from the bar, which was about three kilometres
                    away from home. This
                    would be hours after midnight and she would shout through the quiet night as she addressed her
                    unsolicited speech to
                    those who she knew hated her, those who bewitched her etc. She did this every night. I was lucky to
                    have been picked up
                    by Uncle Joe.
                </p>

                <p>I was studying from a school near home. My mother was, and still is well known in the village. They
                    call her Jamero, my
                    mother tongue for drunkard. In addition to staying up till late every night, waiting for my mum to
                    come staggering into
                    the house, I would listen, like the rest of the village, to her late night rants which were usually
                    insults to her
                    haters, whose names she would sometimes give and sometimes about her sexual escapades and other
                    things that would be on
                    her mind. I can’t explain what it felt like at school the next day when I would find my peers
                    retelling what my mother
                    said then turn to me for a comment since I was Nyiri janmero (a daughter of a drunkard) as they
                    referred to me. She was
                    a good mother when she was not drunk. She made good meals, she would clean, knit and spend time with
                    me. And then she
                    would head back to the bar.
                    By the time I turned 10 years old, I had turned into a mini adult.
                    I knew that she loved me; one minute she was showering me with compliments, the next minute she was
                    screaming, swearing
                    and throwing things at me. I felt I couldn’t do anything right and that I was never good enough. On
                    some level, a big
                    level, I felt I caused her drinking.
                    Alcohol transformed her into a loud, angry, aggressive, violent, abusive and destructive person. She
                    would scream at the
                    top of her lungs about ridiculous things or things that had nothing to do with me or her parents, or
                    even the
                    neighbourhood. She’d throw things across the room. She would hit me. She would take off for days. I
                    would fear she was
                    dead. And most memorable, she would say the cruelest, hurtful things. The hurtful words were far
                    more impactful as they
                    echoed in my mind and scarred me.
                    In tears, I would close myself in the house and plead to God to make her change, but she became
                    worse. On the final day
                    of my first school term, I was approaching home from school and I saw my uncle’s car in the
                    compound. He had come to
                    pick me up. Together with Nana, Uncle Joe had managed to convince mum to let me stay with his
                    family. She went to the
                    bar that night and came back towards day break, this time she was insulting Nana and Uncle Joe for
                    conniving into taking
                    me away from her. Her talk that night made me feel guilty that I was leaving her behind; I worried
                    about her.
                    I was a loner. Even in my uncle’s house I would spend some time by myself, worrying. It all would
                    get more uncomfortable
                    whenever the household would receive visitors from our village who would refer to me as the daughter
                    of a drunkard or
                    even share current and ugly stories about mum in my face.
                    As I joined my mid teen years, I grew to be a perfect rule following child. I was the oldest child
                    in the household and
                    I would occasionally be the one to take care of the other children and I would also carry out house
                    chores. I performed
                    my duties well but I also was a very insecure young woman. I was sexually abused by my math teacher
                    often, who, I think,
                    saw all my insecurities and took advantage of them. I have never told anyone. After my first two
                    years at university I
                    started drinking. Alcohol seemed to temporarily fill a vacuum inside me. I would still feel empty
                    and horrible,
                    following rebukes from our chaplain and a few friends, I stopped the habit and changed friends.
                    I am now a fresh graduate, I visit mum almost every weekend just to make sure she is okay. It is
                    sometimes very
                    depressing. She looks so old and pale, she still drinks, she still shouts her thoughts for the whole
                    village to hear.
                    Nana still gets depressed by her character
                </p>
